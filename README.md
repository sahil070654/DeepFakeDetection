Hello Everyone 
I am M.S.Sahil Baig Prefinal year student of VIT-AP 
I have done a project on Deep Fake detection of Images using ResNet which achieved a accuracy of 78% without any high end model and no GPU is needed. This repo consits of code of the project.
I have used Google Colab for better computational resources. Data set is uploaded in G Drive and used from there.

Link for the dataset will be provided on request.

Any suggestions are accepted


Thank You 

Keep Trying
